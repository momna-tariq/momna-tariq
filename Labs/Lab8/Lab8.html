    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a 4th year student in Business Technology Management at Toronto Metropolitan University. Currently in my fourth year of my 5 year program. 
        With one more academic year remaining, I am looking for a 5th co-op term in Summer 2025. I would be interested in roles involving Data Analytics, UI/UX Design, 
        I have also recently developed a passion for Website Developement/Design.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <p>I recently completed a 16-month internship at L3Harris Technologies as a Business Intelligence Developer. Working on a small team of 2 other members allowed me to leverage their experience and 
        explore until my clock ran out. As the only intern this meant handling large projects autonomously. When I first joined I had no idea the power that data analytics can have. It was always something
        I knew I wished to pursure but had no sense of direction. A year and a half later, I can tell you how important a Business Intelligence team is for a company in terms of effiency and telling a story
        with data.
    </p>
    <p> Previously, I worked for Halton Healthcare as an Information and Communications Technology Support. Initially this was supposed to be an overall support role.
        But this is where I first got to learn about resources such as Power BI Dashboards and how this impacted demographics. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also had to opportunity of sharing my passion for STEM related fields by working as a camp counselor at a STEM Camp. Co-counsellors and I worked deligiently to create
        a fun curriculum that helps kids aged 3-12 years old learn and become exposed to STEM related subjects.
    </p>
    <p> During univerity, I've also taken part in many extra-curriculars such as volunteering to be a TedPack Leader/Mentor, 
        Business conpetitions and Ryerson Data Science Club. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Other</h2>

    <p>I like to spend my free time indulgin in my many hobbies. Depending on my mood I jump between baking, cooking, long drives and exploring new towns/lakes with friends.
        I enjoying making friends and experiencing my hobbies with them. If you make it to my favourites I will share my love for baking with you by giving you treats :). 
    </p>
    <p> My latest interest is playing guitar (I take song requests). In due time, I'm hoping to learn in theory. I also plan on getting back to art and painting soon.</p>
    <p> Around the clock, I am a serial consumer of music and rewatching comedy sitcoms to pass time. My favourite is Modern Family.</p>
